### Project based learning for First year

> https://medzi141.herokuapp.com/

## Overview:
> Getting a proper health facility is a dream for all. Not all hospitals have good facilities, equipment, or experienced personnel to take care of the residents of that city. This problem can be overcome if all the hospitals work in collaboration with each other to ensure everyone can get the proper treatment they need.

> We created a web platform for patients where they can find hospitals based on their requirements, hassle free and book appointments for the same ,get opinions and referrals as well. The hospitals would also have an option to refer patients to another hospital if they lack the proper equipment. This also automatically transfers patient records.

## The key features include:
> Thus, MEDZI is a one stop solution for all recommendations, appointment bookings and referrals
- Appointments: Our webpage is a single stop for all the appointment bookings
- Relevance: Users can sort and find the best and most relevant option for them.
- Maps: With google maps, the users can directly locate the location of hospitals.
